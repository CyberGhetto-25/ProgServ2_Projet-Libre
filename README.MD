### 🤝🏻 Collaboration charter

We, the undersigned, accept and commit to respecting the following rules for a kind, creative, and effective collaboration:

No self-shaming: We celebrate our strengths and laugh at our "failures" as learning opportunities. 🎉
Absolute trust: Everyone’s abilities are an asset, not up for debate. We trust each other, period. ✨
Everyone is unique: "I am Charline, Ana, Marc… and that’s what makes us strong!" 🌈
"Yes, and…": No "no, but…" – we build together with positive and creative ideas. 💡
The right to a coffee (or tea, or hot chocolate) break: Because productivity also means knowing how to unwind. ☕
We share victories: A success is the team’s success. We celebrate together! 👏
No toxic jargon: We avoid phrases like "it’s obvious," "it’s simple," or "you should know." We explain with kindness. 🗣️
"Thank you" is mandatory: A small word for help, an idea, or even a smile. Gratitude is contagious! 🙏
It’s okay not to know: "I don’t know, but I’ll find out" is a perfectly valid answer. 🔍
We celebrate small wins: A project completed? A bug fixed? We mark the moment (even with a GIF or emoji). 🎊
