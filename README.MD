### 🌟 Dream Team Collaboration Charter 🌟

We, the undersigned, commit to fostering a **kind, creative, and effective** collaboration by respecting the following rules:

---
 **Our Rules for Success**

1. **No self-shaming** 🎉
   We celebrate our strengths and embrace our "failures" as learning opportunities.

2. **Absolute trust** ✨
   Everyone’s abilities are an asset. We trust each other, no questions asked.

3. **Everyone is unique** 🌈
   "I am Charline, Ana, Marc… and that’s what makes us strong!"

4. **"Yes, and…"** 💡
   No "no, but…" – we build together with positivity and creativity.

5. **Coffee (or tea, or hot chocolate) breaks are sacred** ☕
   Productivity includes knowing when to recharge.

6. **Victories are shared** 👏
   Success belongs to the whole team. We celebrate together!

7. **No toxic jargon** 🗣️
   Avoid phrases like "it’s obvious" or "you should know." We explain with kindness.

8. **"Thank you" is mandatory** 🙏
   Gratitude matters—whether for help, ideas, or smiles.

9. **It’s okay not to know** 🔍
   "I don’t know, but I’ll find out" is a perfectly valid response.

10. **Small wins deserve celebration** 🎊
    Finished a task? Fixed a bug? Let’s celebrate (even with a GIF or emoji)!
